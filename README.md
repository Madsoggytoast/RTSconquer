##Make sur to read the following:##

##Each dev is working under a branch, your branch is your version to work with based on the master branch. Make sure to stay communicative on what you are changing so others are not overriding others work. You will need to make sure you update to master should there be changes made. Before you do this, of course, make sure you have made pull requests for your branch so that they go into the master.
